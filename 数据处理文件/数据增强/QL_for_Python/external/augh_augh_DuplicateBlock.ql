/**
 * @name Identical code block detection
 * @description Detects code blocks that are exact duplicates of other blocks in the codebase. 
 *              This is a placeholder query that identifies all basic blocks without actual 
 *              duplication analysis. For meaningful duplicate detection, additional logic 
 *              would be required to compare block contents and identify similarities.
