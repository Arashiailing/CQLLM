 * @name Identical code block detection
 * @description Identifies blocks of code that appear multiple times in the codebase. Refactoring shared code into a single location is recommended when feasible. Note that not all duplicates can be automatically resolved; specialized checks for duplicate functions or classes provide more targeted results with higher confidence.
