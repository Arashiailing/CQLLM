/**
 * @name Unmatchable caret in regular expression
 * @description This query identifies regular expressions containing a caret '^' symbol 
 *              in positions other than the start of the pattern. In standard regex modes,
 *              such carets cannot match any input string, rendering the regex pattern
 *              functionally incorrect. The analysis excludes MULTILINE and VERBOSE modes
 *              where the caret character has special behavior that allows it to appear
 *              in non-starting positions.
 * @kind problem
 * @tags reliability
 *       correctness
 * @problem.severity error
 * @sub-severity low
 * @precision high
