/**
 * @name Duplicate Code Block Detection
 * @description This rule identifies code blocks that are duplicated and could potentially be refactored.
 * It is designed to catch code duplication that might be missed by more specific duplicate detection 
 * mechanisms (such as function or class level). Note: The findings require manual review because 
 * not all duplicated code can be automatically refactored.
 * @kind problem

 *       duplicate-code
 *       statistical
